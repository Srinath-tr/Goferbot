        Overview
        --------
        
        The ``ad`` package allows you to **easily** and **transparently** perform 
        **first and second-order automatic differentiation**. Advanced math 
        involving trigonometric, logarithmic, hyperbolic, etc. functions can also 
        be evaluated directly using the ``admath`` sub-module. 
        
        **All base numeric types are supported** (``int``, ``float``, ``complex``, 
        etc.). This package is designed so that the underlying numeric types will 
        interact with each other *as they normally do* when performing any 
        calculations. Thus, this package acts more like a "wrapper" that simply helps 
        keep track of derivatives while **maintaining the original functionality** of 
        the numeric calculations.
        
        From the Wikipedia entry on `Automatic differentiation`_ (AD):
        
            "AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how 
            complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations 
            (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary 
            functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule 
            repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be 
            computed automatically, and accurate to working precision."
        
        See the `package documentation`_ for details and examples.
        
        Main Features
        -------------
        
        - **Transparent calculations with derivatives: no or little 
          modification of existing code** is needed, including when using
          the `Numpy`_ module.
        
        - **Almost all mathematical operations** are supported, including
          functions from the standard math_ module (sin, cos, exp, erf, 
          etc.) and cmath_ module (phase, polar, etc.) with additional convenience 
          trigonometric, hyperbolic, and logarithmic functions (csc, acoth, ln, etc.).
          Comparison operators follow the **same rules as the underlying numeric 
          types**.
        
        - **Real and complex** arithmetic handled seamlessly. Treat objects as you
          normally would using the `math`_ and `cmath`_ functions, but with their new 
          ``admath`` counterparts.
          
        - **Automatic gradient and hessian function generator** for optimization 
          studies using `scipy.optimize`_ routines with ``gh(your_func_here)``.
        
        - **Compatible Linear Algebra Routines** in the ``ad.linalg`` submodule, 
          similar to those found in NumPy's ``linalg`` submodule, that are not 
          dependent on LAPACK. There are currently:
          
          a. Decompositions
             
             1. ``chol``: Cholesky Decomposition
             2. ``lu``: LU Decomposition
             3. ``qr``: QR Decomposition
          
          b. Solving equations and inverting matrices
             
             1. ``solve``: General solver for linear systems of equations
             2. ``lstsq``: Least-squares solver for linear systems of equations
             3. ``inv``: Solve for the (multiplicative) inverse of a matrix
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You have several easy, convenient options to install the ``ad`` package 
        (administrative privileges may be required):
        
        1. Download the package files below, unzip to any directory, and run 
           ``python setup.py install`` from the command-line.
           
        2. Simply copy the unzipped ``ad-XYZ`` directory to any other location 
           that python can find it and rename it ``ad``.
           
        3. If ``setuptools`` is installed, run ``easy_install --upgrade ad`` 
           from the command-line.
           
        4. If ``pip`` is installed, run ``pip install --upgrade ad`` from the 
           command-line.
        
        5. Download the *bleeding-edge* version on GitHub_
