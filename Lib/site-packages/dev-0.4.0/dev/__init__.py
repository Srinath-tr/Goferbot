ðŸš§ About
--------

dev is a collection of Python developer tools presented as a
modest alternative to the standard library's offering.

.. warning:: dev is a work in progress

Testing
-------

:py:mod`dev.libtest` is a protocol driven testing library. Users need not import libtest
in order to define their tests, only to run them. This means that test modules can be
imported without `dev` being available.

:py:mod:`dev.libtest` attempts to make constructing test runners as simple as possible by
keeping the interface as simple as possible.

`fail_if_*` is the designated prefix::

	import something
	def test_something(test):
		expectation = (2,5)
		test.fail_if_not_equal(expectation, something.calculate(1))

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		import dev.libtest; dev.libtest.execmodule()

Skeletons
---------

The executable module `dev.bin.init` initializes a new package directory
complete with `setup.py` script. The following is the consistency of the
layout from a `python -m dev.bin.init package` run::

	package/
		__init__.py
		lib.py [empty "primary" module]
		test/
			test_lib.py
		bin/
		release/
			xdistutils.py [module distutils data]
			pypi.py [pypi specific data goes here]
		documentation/
			usage.rst
			project.rst
			reference.rst
			index.rst
			sphinx/
				conf.py
				build.sh
