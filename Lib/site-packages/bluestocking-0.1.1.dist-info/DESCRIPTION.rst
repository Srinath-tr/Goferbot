This project depends on NLTK.  You will need to install it before running these scripts.

To run tests:

    python tests.py

To run factchecker demo, try this:

    python factchecker.py "The sky is not blue."

or this:

    python factchecker.py "People never eat fish. Goldfish are unpopular."

This test a document against the Simple English Wikipedia
articles for each word in the tested document.  Try
replacing test-factchecker.txt with your own text file!

(Warning: documents with long sentences take longer to query)

Scripts included:

### parse.py

Defines Document class for wrapping raw text and Parser
class for extracting Relations from a Document.

Relations encapsulate a semantically significant lexical
cooccurence.

Documents have a method to turn them into Doxaments (see below).

### doxament.py

Defines a Doxament class.  A Doxament contains many Relations.
A Doxament may be queried for consistency with another Doxament.  They may also be merged to form a more complete knowledge base.

### other

wikipedia.py and wiki2plain.py from
