    <H3>A Brief History Of Conversational AI</H3>

    <P>The <A
    HREF="http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/~asaygin/tt/ttest.html">Turing
    Test</A> was proposed by legendary computer science pioneer Alan
    Turing as a way of measuring the intelligence of a computer
    program.  Basically, the test challenges an artifical intelligence
    program to convince a human judge that it is human.  The Turing
    Test was fiirst proposed in 1950, and despite a half-century of
    progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence, not a single
    program has ever passed it.</P>

    <P>Nevertheless, people keep trying.  Every year, a handful of the
    world's best conversational AI programs square off in the <A
    HREF="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html">Loebner
    Prize Content</A> (basically a formalized Turing Test, with a
    grand prize of US$100,000 to the first program to fool the human
    judges).  However, after looking at the <A
    HREF="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/dwrc/loebner/results.html">results
    of the 2003 Loebner Prize Contest</A>, it's clear that
    conversational AI programs have a long way to go before they have
    any hope of passing as humans.</P>

    <P>Several of the "best" Loebner entries are available on the Web.
    You can test your conversational mettle against <A
    HREF="http://megahal.sourceforge.net">MegaHAL</A>, <A
    HREF="http://www.manifestation.com/neurotoys/eliza.php3">Eliza</A>,
    or <A HREF="http://www.alicebot.org/">A.L.I.C.E.</A> (the closest
    thing Howie has to a mother).</P>

    <P>After conversing with a few chatterbots, or reading over
    conversational transcripts, one begins to notice a pattern:
    computers really aren't that interesting to talk to.  Most
    conversations start out innocently enough, exchanging pleasantries
    and such.  Before too long, however, the conversation devolves
    into one of the following scenarios:

    <UL>

      <LI>The human begins propositioning the computer for sex. This
      behavior is so universally predictable that most chatterbots are
      actually quite comfortable with the topic.  (Try this with
      A.L.I.C.E., incidentally).</LI>

      <LI>The computer suffers a logic error, and spits out a <I>non
      sequitor</I>.  Depending on how interesting/humorous the
      computer's response is, the human continues to feed in
      increasingly nonsensical input, curious to see how the program
      will respond.</LI>

      <LI>The program suffers from severe short-term memory loss (an
      affliction which is sadly widespread in modern conversational
      AIs), and becomes unable to remember anything further back than
      the most recent human statement.  The conversation quickly
      becomes a stream of content-free conversational no-ops
      (e.g. "Ah, I understand.", "You do?", "Yes.", "Good.", "You are
      pleased?", "Yes.", "Excellent.", "Thank you.", "You're
      welcome!", "Don't mention it.", and so on).  Eventually, the
      human loses interest.</P>

    </UL>

    <P>In short, you aren't going to see Howie entering the Loebner
    Prize Contest any time soon.  Howie is proud to stand and be
    counted among the losers!</P>
